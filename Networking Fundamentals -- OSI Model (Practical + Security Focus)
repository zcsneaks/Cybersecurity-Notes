Networking Fundamentals -- OSI Model (Practical + Security Focus)

OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)
⦁	a 7-layer framework that standardizes how devices communicate on a network
⦁	allows different systems to work together even if built differently
⦁	encapsulation - data gets wrapped with headers/metadata at each layer before being sent

Layer 1 -- Physical
⦁	hardware that physically moves bit (1s and 0s)
⦁	cables, wi-fi signals, network cards, electrical signals
⦁	no data understanding, only transmission
⦁	examples: ethernet cables, fiber cables, radio waves, hubs

Layer 2 -- Data Link
⦁	handles MAC (physical) addressing and local communication
⦁	adds MAC addresses to frames before sending
⦁	uses switches (layer 2 devices)
⦁	security note: can be attacked via MAC spoofing or switch flooding

Layer 3 -- Network
⦁	handles IP addressing and routing (finding best path)
⦁	uses routers (layer 3 devices)
⦁	chooses paths based on:
- shortest path
- fastest link
- most reliable route
⦁	routing protocols include:
OSPF
RIP
BGP (most important on the internet)
⦁	security note: targeted by attacks like ICMP floods, routing attacks, IP spoofing

Layer 4 -- Transport
⦁	Ensures data gets delivered properly (or quickly)
⦁	Uses TCP or UDP
⦁	TCP -- Reliable
- 3-Way Handshake: SYN -> SYN/ACK -> ACK
- Ensures delivery, resends lost packets, ordered packets
- slower but accurate
- used for: HTTP/HTTPS, SSH, FTP, email
- Security note: can be attacked via SYN floods (DDoS)
⦁	UDP -- Fast
- No connection, no reliability fire-and-forget
- faster, reduces delay
- used for: streaming, games, VoIP, DNS
- Security note: can be abused in UDP flood attacks

Layer 5 -- Session
⦁	creates, maintains, and closes connections between devices
⦁	adds checkpoints to resume transfers if interrupted
⦁	sessions are unique -- data can't swap between sessions
⦁	security note: targeted by session hijacking

Layer 6 -- Presentation
⦁	translates, formats, compresses, and encrypts data
⦁	encryption happens here (ex: HTTPS/TLS/SSL)
⦁	converts data into readable format (JPEG, MP4, JSON, etc)
⦁	security note: if encryption is stripped, attacker can read traffic (SSL stripping attacks)

Layer 7 -- Application
⦁	closest to the user -- interfaces and network apps
⦁	not the app itself. but the protocols apps use
⦁	protocols include: HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, FTP, SSH, SMTP
⦁	security note: most hacked layer (phishing, web exploits, login abuse, API abuse)
