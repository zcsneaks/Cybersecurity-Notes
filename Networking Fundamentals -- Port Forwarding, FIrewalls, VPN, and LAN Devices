Port Forwarding
⦁	Allows external devices on the Internet to access specific internal devices (like web services) inside a private network
⦁	Configured on the router -- tells it which internal IP + port incoming traffic should be sent to
⦁	Example: 82.62.51.70:80 -> forwards to 192.168.1.10:80
⦁	Firewalls control whether the traffic is allowed; port forwarding can expoe private systems or admin panels to the internet
⦁	Red-Team Insight:
⦁	Attackers scan public IPs for open ports (via Nmap) to find services exposed via port forwarding. Misconfigured port forwarding can expose private systems or admin panels to the internet

Firewalls
⦁	Control which traffic can enter or leave a network
⦁	Rules based on:
⦁	Source/destination IP
⦁	Port number
⦁	Protocol (TCP/UDP)
⦁	Like border security -- decides what gets in or out
⦁	Stateless
⦁	Uses fixed rules to allow/block packets
⦁	fast, simple
⦁	less intelligent; easier to bypass
⦁	Stateful
⦁	analyzes connection states & traffic patterns
⦁	smarter, adaptive
⦁	uses more system resources
⦁	Red-Team Insight:
⦁	attackers often test firewall rules by sending packets with odd flags (ex. XMAS scans) or manipulate traffic timing to infer open prots behind firewalls

VPN (Virtual Private Network)
⦁	Creates an encrypted tunnel between devices across the internet
⦁	Allows private communication between remote networks
⦁	Used to connect branch offices, secure remote users, or mask identity
⦁	Encryption ensures only devices with matching keys can read data
⦁	VPN technologies
⦁	PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)
⦁	provides authentication & encryption base
⦁	not routable alone
⦁	PPTP (Point to Point Tunneling Protocol)
⦁	Easy to setup but weak encryption
⦁	IPsec (Internet Security Protocol)
⦁	Strong encryption using IP layer
⦁	Secure, harder to configure
⦁	Benefits:
⦁	Privacy: hides traffic from ISP & public WI-Fi snoopers
⦁	Anonymity: masks your real IP
⦁	Remote Access: securely links different offices
⦁	Red-Team Insight:
⦁	VPNs protect traffic -- but if compromised, attackers gain internal network-level access. Misconfigured VPNs can also expose internal IPs

LAN Networking Devices
⦁	Router
⦁	Connects different networks (LAN <-> WAN)
⦁	Uses routing protocols (OSPF, RIP, BGP) to find best paths
⦁	Works at layer 3 (network) of OSI Model
⦁	Handles port forwarding and firewall rules
⦁	Red-Team Insight:
⦁	Router misconfigurations or default credentials can give full internal network control. Attackers exploit outdates firmware or open admin panels

Switch (LAN Device)
⦁	Connects multiple devices inside a LAN
⦁	Operates at layer 2 (data link), forwarding frames using MAC addresses
⦁	Layer 3 switches can also handle IP routing (acts partly like a router)

VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)
⦁	Splits one physical switch into multiple virtual networks, improving security and segmentation
⦁	Devices in different VLANs can't directly talk without a router or firewall
⦁	Red-Team Insight:
⦁	Attackers can use VLAN hopping techniques (like double tagging) to move between separated networks if VLANs are misconfigured
