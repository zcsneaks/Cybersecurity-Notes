Networking
⦁	Networking - devices connected to share information/resources
⦁	Examples: transport systems, power grids, social networks, postal systems

Internet
⦁	ARPANET (1960s) = first major network
⦁	WWW created by Tim Berners-Lee (1989) and runs on top of the internet
⦁	The internet = many interconnected private and public networks

Device Identification on a Network
⦁	A device is identified by:
- IP address: like your name, can change, used for network routing
- MAC Address: like your fingerprint, hardware ID, unique to your device

IP (Internet Protocol)
⦁	IPv4 = 4 sections (octets), ex: 192.168.1.1
⦁	Public IP = faces the internet, assigned by your ISP
⦁	Private IP = used inside local networks (home/company), not internet routable
- Class A = 10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255 (Used by large companies)
- Class B = 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255 (Used by medium sized companies)
- Class C = 192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255 (Used by small companies and homes)
⦁	Cannot have the same IP twice on the same network at the same time
⦁	IPv6 = huge address space to replace IPv4 shortages, more efficient routing
⦁	Machines on private IPs can't be targeted directly from the internet without port forwarding, VPN access, or misconfiguration
- Port forwarding: the router's public IP receives incoming traffic and forwards a specific port (ex. TCP 22) to a chosen private IP on your LAN (ex. router forwards public:2222 -> 192.168.1.50:22
- VPN / Remote Access: if you run a VPN server on the network (or use a corporate VPN), remote clients join the private network and directly access private IPs as if they were local
- Misconfiguration / UPnP / DMZ: routers can auto-map ports (UPnP) or place a host in the DMZ exposing it to the internet - this unintentionally makes private hosts reachable
- Security note (short): any of these methods exposes the private host to the internet - port forwarding and UPnP increase attack surface, so secure and monitor those services

MAC (Media Access Control)
⦁	Hardware address embedded in network interface card (NIC)
- NIC = the hardware (physical or virtual) in a device that connects it to a network (ex. Ethernet port or wifi adapter)
	- Visible in OS as an interface name (Linux: eth0, wlan0); it has the MAC address baked into the interface
⦁	Format: 'xx.xx.xx.xx.xx.xx' (12 hex characters)
- First 6 = manufacturer (OUI)
	- OUI: Organizationally Unique Identifier
	- You can look up OUI to see vendor (use 'ip link'/'ifconfig' to get the MAC and an online OUI lookup to match map vendor)
- Last 6 = unique device ID
⦁	Can be spoofed or "faked" to imitate another device
⦁	Only usable inside the local network - does not travel across the internet

Ping & ICMP
⦁	Ping uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
⦁	Checks if a device is reachable & measures response time
⦁	Terminal command:
ping 8.8.8.8
ping google.com
⦁	Able to be blocked, so no response does not mean the machine is down
