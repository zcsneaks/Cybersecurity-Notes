What is DNS?
⦁	DNS (Domain Name System) maps human-readable names (like tryhackme.com) to IP addresses (104.26.10.229), so we don't have to remember numbers
⦁	Works like a phone book / contacts app for the internet

Domain Hierarchy
1.	TLD (Top-Level Domain)
- Right-most part of a domain.
	- Ex: tryhackme.com --> TLD = .com
- Types:
	- gTLD: generic (.com, .org, .net, .online, etc.)
	- ccTLD: country-code (.uk, .ca, .jp, etc)
2.	Second-Level Domain (SLD)
- The main name you register.
	- Ex: tryhackme.com --> SLD = tryhackme
- Label rules: max 63 characters, only a-z, 0-9, and - (no starting/ending hyphens)
3.	Subdomain
- Sits to the left of the SLD
	- Ex: admin.tryhackme.com --> admin = subdomain
	- Can chain: Jupiter.servers.tryhackme.com
- FQDN (full domain) total length must be < 254 characters

Common DNS Record Types
⦁	A record
	- Maps names --> IPv4 Address
	- Ex: website.thm --> 10.10.10.10
⦁	AAAA Record
	- Maps name --> IPv6 Address
	- Ex: example.com --> 2606:4700:20::681a:be5
⦁	CNAME Record (canonical name)
	- Name --> another domain name, not an IP
- Ex: shop.website.thm --> shops.myshopify.com
- A second DNS lookup then resolves shops.myshopify.com to an IP
⦁	MX Record (Mail Exchanger)
- Tells which server(s) handle email for a domain.
- Includes a priority number (lower = tried first)
- Ex: website.thm --> 30 alt4.aspmx.l.google.com
⦁	TXT Record
- Free-form text data. Common uses:
	- SPF, DKIM, DMARC (anti-spam / anti-spoofing)
	- Domain ownership verification

DNS Resolution Flow (How a Query is Resolved)
1.	Client cache check
- Your OS/Browser checks its local DNS cache first
2.	Recursive Resolver (usually ISP or custom like 8.8.8.8)
- If not cached locally, query is sent to a recursive DNS server
- If the resolver has it cached, it replies directly
3.	Root DNS servers
- If not cached, resolver asks a root server
- Root server says: "For .com domains, go ask these TLD servers."
4.	TLD Server (.com, .net, .org, etc)
- TLD server says; "For tryhackme.com, ask these authoritative name servers"
5.	Authoritative Name Server
- Holds the actual DNS records for the domain (A, MX, CNAME, etc)
- Sends back the answer to the recursive server --> recursive caches it --> returns it to your device
6.	TTL (Time to Live)
- Each DNS record has a TTL (in seconds) that tell show long it can be cached
- Caching speeds things up and reduces DNS traffic

Red-Team Mindset Extras
⦁	DNS is an intel goldmine: Attackers perform subdomain enumeration, zone transfers (if misconfigured), and read TXT records for tech stack clues
⦁	DNS cache poisoning / spoofing can redirect users to malicious IPs while still showing the correct domain name in the browser
⦁	Misconfigured DNS (bad MX/TXT/SPF) can allow email spoofing and phishing that looks legit
