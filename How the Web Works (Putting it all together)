Components of the Web
⦁	CDN (Content Delivery Network) hosts static files and speeds up a clients visit to a website. It basically hosts the static files like JavaSciprt, CSS, Images, Videos, etc and hosts them across thousands of servers all over the world and the user connects to the nearest server.
⦁	Load balancers perform "health checks" to make sure hosts are still alive. If the server doesn't respond it will stop sending traffic to it until it responds.
⦁	WAF (Web Application Firewall) help defend websites by analyzing requests for common attack techniques.

How Web Servers Work
⦁	Web server software uses "virtual hosts" to host multiple sites.
⦁	Static content doesn't change. These are things like images, videos, JavaScript, CSS, etc
⦁	Dynamic content can change. For example, on a blog the home page will update with the most recent blog. 
⦁	The client can't see the backend code.

How a Request to a Website Works
1.	Request website in your browser
2.	Check local cache for IP address
3.	Check your recursive DNS Server for IP address
4.	Query root server to find authoritative DNS server
5.	Authoritative DNS server advises the IP address for the website
6.	Request passes through a WAF (Web Application Firewall)
7.	Request passes through a Load Balancer
8.	Connects to webserver on port 80 or 443
9.	Web server receives GET request from client
10.	Web application talks to database
11.	Your browser renders the HTML into a viewable website
